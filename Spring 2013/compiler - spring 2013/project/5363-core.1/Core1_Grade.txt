- Many nodes that should be colored are not.
- Terminated with exception instead of specifying a type or syntax error
  on one test case:
    Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException
	  at edu.utsa.tl13.Expression.typeChecking(Expression.java:42)
- Terminated with exception on a correct test cases with nested while and if
  statements:
    Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException
	  at edu.utsa.tl13.Parser.parse(Parser.java:41)
- The leaf nodes that cause type errors are often not colored red.
- Did not throw type error when condition expression of IF statement was of type
  INT (should only allow type bool).
- Reported no type error when INT literal was out of range, but did color it red
  on AST.
